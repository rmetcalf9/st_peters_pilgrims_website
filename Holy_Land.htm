</font>We have had to cancel and postpone a large number of Pilgrimages to the Holy Land through Autumn 2000 and Spring 2001.
We must follow the official advice of the British Government Foreign Office and
although they did not advise Pilgrims against travel to Israel, they did advise us not to go to certain Cities including Bethlehem, Nazareth, Jerico and Jerusalem, the very places on which our Pilgrimage is based.<br>
<br>
We would not put our Pilgrims in any sort of danger nor would we take Pilgrims to Israel when the Foreign
Office advised against travel to three or more of the Holy Places on our itinerary. We therefore took the initiative ourselves to
very regretfully cancel the Pilgrimages. We refunded Pilgrimage costs in full without any deductions what so ever.<br>
<br>
We pray we might soon resume our Pilgrimages. For the sake of those that live in the Holy Land, Pray
that the present efforts will lead to a just &amp; lasting peace.</b></i></p>

Church now forming the Sanctuary. After Mass we visit the upper part of the

Beatitudes with it’s marvelous Italian church. Then to Tabgha, the scene of
the miracle of the loaves and fishes where we will celebrate Mass on the Sea
shore. In the church we will find the famous 4th century mosaic has been
incorporated in the beautiful reconstruction of the Byzantine Basilica. A short
ride away is the church of the Primacy of Peter which is built over the Rock
where Christ called Peter to be the rock of His Church. At Capernaum we remember
Christ's Galilean ministry for it was here that it was centred and it was here
that he called Peter, Matthew and Andrew. We see the remains of the Synagogue
where He taught and House of Peter, the first Christian Church.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

Jordan Valley. Shops, fruit, refreshments abound. We hear the story of Zacchaeus
climbing the sycamore tree and from a suitable view point we look up at the

the desert.<o:p>

continue to the mountain of Masada and the Dead Sea (Usually an optional extra
but included in this itinerary) Masada has two great stories. First, that of
Herod the Great &amp; his tremendous palace. Second the story of the five year
Roman siege of the 900 Jewish Zealots who preferred to die by their own hand, as
free men, rather than become pagan slaves. We take a cable car to the top with
our guide. Afterwards, lunch and a couple of relaxed hours by the Dead Sea at
the Ein Gedi private resort (Cost included). As well as bathing, we can cake
ourselves in the famous, black Dead Sea mud and take the hot sulphur health

members spent much of their time copying the Gospels and who left us The Dead
Sea Scrolls! We will find a suitable spot in the Desert for an open air Mass to
remember Christ’s time in the desert. On the road to Jerusalem we find the Inn
of the Good Samaritan. Typical, and the sort of place Jesus had in mind when He
gave us this parable. With its well and its Bedouin welcome it is a good place
to pause and hear the story. We arrive at our Jerusalem hotel in time for our
evening meal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>For the energetic, an<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

Paternoster Church. Around the Church and garden we find the Prayer in ceramics
in every language under the sun! The Mount of Olives lies across the Kidron
Valley from the Eastern Wall of the Old City and gives us one of the most
spectacular views. The Golden Gate, the Temple Mount, the Golden Dome, the Dome
of the Holy Sepulchre. From here we really understand why Jesus wept over
Jerusalem and we remember that at Mass in the Church of Dominus Flevit. At the
